			So the needs of the daily money expense tracker is already bugging me for years. 
			At those times i wrote my own python cli based app for that which runs on my linux, it is one of those my personal assistants relying on my Guake.
		</p>
		<p>
			In late 2014 after finishing my bachelor study, i realized the need of GPS to accompany me traveling outside the town, further than my previous travels.
			So i bought myself an Android smartphone, for the sake of the GPS &amp; map navigation. (yoi, my first smartphone, at the age of 22)
		</p>
		<p>
			In early 2015, after moving to work in Banten i found a good application for that in Android PlayStore: 
			<em>Income and Expense Insight</em> which i used to use a lot. 
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="linespacer"></div>
	<p> 
		<h2>Incomes &amp; Expenses Insight</h2> is a good app: Fasten the creation of Transaction for all your daily need, 
		as all income moves to a single Account, and expense comes from a single Account. I used it to track my Cash-in-hand. 
		But then, I still needed to track my Bank account using other application.
		until in mid July 2015 i learned myself an Android Development with Java, and i want to add something usefull (to me at least): Multiple Bank account.
	</p>
	<div class="quote">in every data input, the income &amp; expense flow to a single account: the so-called <b>Base account</b></div>
	<p>
		Some people might said, it would be just the same as common accounting: input data so that incomes equal expenses. 
		But let's keep the simplicity of the application which aimed for daily simple transaction: 
		in every data input, the income &amp; expense flow to a single account: the so-called <b>Base account</b>
		The next simplicity is that the autogenerated reference number, which the user does not have to bother seing it, nor writing it himself. 
		All s/he need to write is description, which is not even mandatory!
